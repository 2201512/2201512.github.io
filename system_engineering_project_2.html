                <h1>Systems Engineering Project 2</h1>
            </header>
            <p>A System Engineering focused Project, that builds upon the foundation learnt in SEP1 to further develop Practical and Applicable System Engineering Knowledge.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Project Objective</h2>
                <p>The main objective of this project was to leverage the technical knowledge from Systems Engineering and the technical skills in Mechanical, Electrical, and Software Engineering to prototype an improvement for the existing Evebot Food Printing Pen.</p>

                <h2>Initiation</h2>
                <h3>Iron Triangle of Project Management</h3>
                <p>Understanding how to prioritize and when to decide on outcomes is crucial in project management. The Iron Triangle helps us balance the constraints of scope, time, and cost. In this project, we considered:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Push:</strong> Identifying an opportunity or solution that the domain may not currently need but could benefit from upon creation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pull:</strong> Identifying the needs within relevant domains and finding functionalities that could meet these needs.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Concept of "Fuzzy"</h2>
                <h3>Adaptation</h3>
                <p>As we generate innovative solutions during the Concept Definition phase, many ideas will be "fuzzy" or vague. The needs from various domains and the functionalities to address them might not be immediately clear.</p>
                <p>For example, in the space domain, food printing is desired because transporting food from Earth to space is expensive. Potential solutions, such as using recycled materials as filament, may not be apparent through keyword searches alone. Broader concepts like repurposing or reusing materials can provide unexpected solutions from other domains.</p>
                <p>An illustrative example is the space and origami domains. When optimizing how to pack large objects into rockets, such as the Webb telescope, researchers looked to origami for solutions. This connection would have been hard to identify with traditional keyword searches.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Problem Space</h2>
                <p>In the Problem Space, we aim to define an opportunity or problem. Given that the outcome is an Evebot that produces something edible, we initially explored food and food printing domains for potential needs. Concurrently, we examined functionalities that could meet these needs using two main methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fuzzy Notion:</strong> Researching needs to derive domains.</li>
                    <li><strong>Occam’s Razor:</strong> Exploring functionalities within the food printing domain that could be repurposed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Hump Diagram, despite its complexity, emphasizes that all processes in Systems Engineering occur concurrently, with varying emphasis at different stages. Even during the idea conception phase, design considerations must be taken into account. This perspective allows us to eliminate impractical research ideas early on.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Failed Design Concepts</h2>
                <p>Several concepts were explored but ultimately discarded for various reasons:</p>
                <h3>Pull Type Solutions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reused the Evebot without significant innovation.</li>
                    <li>Required extensive modifications to the Evebot, conflicting with project constraints.</li>
                    <li>Demanded domain knowledge beyond the team's expertise.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Push Type Solutions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blind User Aided Evebot:</strong> Assisted blind users with a machine vision camera (Pixycam) and audio cues. Applications: Restaurants employing disabled individuals. Problems: Can be resolved with automated printers; niche audience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Handheld 3D Food Printer Evebot:</strong> Created 3D printed edible structures using a technique similar to binder jetting. Applications: Various domains. Problems: Requires chemistry expertise; Evebot’s output is insufficient.</li>
                    <li><strong>Software Update for Larger Images:</strong> Allowed image uploads to print sections of a larger image. Applications: Various domains. Problems: API limitations; can be done manually but is tedious.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Finalized Solution: Freehand Evebot</h3>
                <p>We decided on creating an adapter for freehand sketching with the Evebot. Applications are across various domains. Logical and practical to pursue.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Solution Space</h2>
                <p>The finalized solution involves creating an adapter for the Evebot that allows for freehand sketching. This solution was chosen for its practicality and potential applications across various domains.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Finalized Solution</h2>
                <h3>Rationale</h3>
                <p>The rationale behind this solution includes its feasibility, alignment with project constraints, and potential for broad application.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Iteration</h2>
                <p>The project underwent several iterations to refine the design and functionality of the freehand Evebot adapter, ensuring it met the project's objectives and constraints.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Future Work</h2>
                <p>Future work includes further refining the freehand Evebot, exploring additional applications, and potentially developing complementary features to enhance its functionality.</p>
